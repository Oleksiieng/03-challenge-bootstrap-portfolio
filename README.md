![The webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./images/screen1.png)



> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.


### User Story

* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
* Used flexbox, CSS Grid, media queries, and CSS variables
